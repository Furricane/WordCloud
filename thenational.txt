Could you tell the enchantment I said goodbye?
I met a girl named disillusionment
Could you tell her I made the headlines?
Says "boy draws wings on everything"
Could you tell her to check the headlines?
Says "boy burns angels in the river"

[Chorus]
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years

Birds are flying out of water
Underneath the sky
I run up to the rainbow girl
Just to pass it by
And I'll never have a change of heart
My swan will never sing
I have no heart, the swan is gone
And now I wear the wings

[Chorus]

You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before I saw you


So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost

But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us
Grace
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today




[Verse 1]
Well, I know that you know
That you've become the target of this hand
With never even asking
Well, I know that you know
That you're the only thing that I can stand
So how could your hair
Have the nerve to dance around like that, blowing?
And how could the air
Have the nerve to blow your hair around like that?

[Chorus 1]
I'm waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm looking for a trapdoor trigger
To drop me out of your view

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm listening, I'm listening
I can tell that you are serious
You're looking for that hurt look around my mouth
The look of a steep fall, yeah, that's how Hersey put it
So you can make another claim
Well, go ahead and make it
So you can make another claim
Well, go ahead and make it

[Chorus 2]
I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trapdoor trigger

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Yes, I'm listening
I can tell you're serious




[Chorus]
Well, my mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right

[Verse 1]
Abel, come on, give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong
Abel, come on, give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see water on the bridge
Well, you better hold my hand through this
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down

[Chorus]
Well, my mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right

[Verse 2]
Abel, come on, give me a reason
I am not as bright as I could be
Abel, come on, take me with you
Everything has all gone down wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You turn me good and God-fearing
Well, tell me what am I supposed to do with that?
I'm missing something
Yeah, I'm missing something

[Bridge]
My mind's gone loose inside its shell
My mind's gone loose inside the shell
Well, I'm missing something, yeah I'm missing something
Abel, my mind's gone loose inside the shell

[Chorus]
Well, my mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right




Abel, come on
Give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong
Abel, come on
Give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong

I see water on the bridge
Well, you better hold my hand through this
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down

Well, my mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right

Abel, come on
Give me a reason
I am not as bright as I could be
Abel, come on
Take me with you
Everything has all gone down wrong

You turn me good and God-fearing
Well, tell me what am I supposed to do with that
I'm missing something
Yeah, I'm missing something

My mind's gone loose inside this shell
My mind's gone loose inside this shell
Yeah, I'm missing something, I'm missing something
My mind's gone loose inside the shell

Well, my mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right

[Verse 1]
Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you "Why?"
What could I say?
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say?

[Chorus]
How close am I
To losing you?

[Verse 2]
Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

[Chorus]
How close am I
To losing you?

[Verse 3]
Hey
Are you awake?
Yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today?

[Chorus]
How close am I
To losing you?
How close am I
To losing?




Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck

Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you

Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
Waiting for Ada
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall

Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way 'round




[Verse 1]
Venom radio and
Venom television
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone
Lay the young blue bodies
With the old red bodies
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone

[Hook]
With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

[Verse 2]
I defend my family
With my orange umbrella
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone
With my shining new star
Spangled tennis shoes on
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone

[Hook]
With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out
I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

[Outro]
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul

Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul




[Verse 1]
I think I saw you riding in a car
You looked happy for a woman
Black fingers in your mouth and a white
And a white pearl choker

[Verse 2]
My head plays it over and over
Don't interrupt me
I think I saw you reaching for a glass
With your lanky white arms
Nothing else moves that way. Are you kidding me?
My head plays it over and over
Don't interrupt me

[Chorus]
All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been?

[Verse 3]
I think I saw you walking in the city
Hips like boy's
The sun fell behind you and never stood up
My head plays it over and over
I think I heard you singing
"Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?"
My head plays it over and over

[Chorus]
All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been?

[Refrain]
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?




[Verse 1]
I'm put together so beautifully
Big wet bottle in my fist
Big wet rose in my teeth
I'm a perfect piece of ass
Like every Californian
So tall I take over the street
With high-beams shining up my back
A wingspan unbelievable
I'm a festival
I'm a parade

[Hook]
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me

[Verse 2]
I'm a birthday candle in a circle of black girls
God is on my side
Cause I'm the child-bride
I'm so sorry but the motorcade will have to go around me this time
Cause God is on my side
And I'm the child-bride

[Hook]
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me

[Bridge]
I carry the dollhouse safe on my shoulders
Through the black city
Nightlights are on in the corners
And everyone's sleeping upstairs
All safe and sound, all safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around
All safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around

[Ending]
I'm in a state
I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love
I'm in a state
I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love




Give my jewels to the army
My silverware and jeans
Give my love to your family
Tell them anything

Give yourself to anyone
Give yourself away
Don't be a nightingale
For anyone's space to fill

If I could, I'd be your star again
Fall across your falling sky

It takes a lot of little rain
To make you feel like nothing
Anything, anything you care to do
Do to me for everything I did for you

Nothing

I didn't try to take your love away
I just never knew I had it

[chorus]
There is nothing you can say
To ever make me want you
American...
There is nothing you can say
To ever make me leave you
American...

American Mary

If you kiss me, kiss me with your silver eyes
Don't look at me like someone you don't recognize
I didn't try to do this

Your arms around my shoulder blades
Are useless

[chorus]

American Mary
American Mary




Everyone is watching
But nobody is watching for you
I don't wanna turn it on
It only makes me sad for you
I know you can play piano
That was just a talent show
I've never known you like I know you
I never wanted you to go

You're on the rocks in a two-piece suit
In a dead location on the dying scene
You gave Lawrence a big salute
Texas brought them to their knees
Indiana pushes you on the stairs
Your independent declaration sounded too much like a prayer

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you

Anna Freud
No confidence in Anna
In Anna Freud

Remember what they said to you
Everyone will know us now
We love you babe, you make us proud
Don't come home without the crown
Don't come back to Lawrence town
We always knew you'd let us down
Don't come back without the crown

Anna Freud
No confidence in Anna
In Anna Freud

Anna Freud
No confidence in Anna
In Anna Freud

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you




Say you stayed home
Alone with the flu
Find out from friends
That wasn't true
Go out at night
With your headphones on again
And walk through
The Manhattan valleys of the dead
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
You said I came close
As anyone's come
To live underwater
For more than a month
You said it was not inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I had a hole in the middle
Where the lightning went through it
Told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle
Someone's sideshow wouldn't do it
I told my friends not to worry
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost




[Verse 1]
Say you stayed at home
Alone with the flu
Find out from friends
That wasn't true
Go out at night with your headphones on, again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of the dead

[Hook]
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost

[Refrain]
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

[Verse 2]
You said I came close
As anyone's come
To live underwater
For more than a month
You said it was night inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost

I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle someone's sideshow to do
I told my friends not to worry

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost




You say you stayed home

Go out at night with your headphones on
Again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of
The dead

I told my friends not to worry

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost




[Verse 1]
Be still for a second while I try and try to pin your flowers on
Can you carry my drink I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we're so disarming darling, everything we did believe
Is diving diving diving diving off the balcony

[Chorus]
Tired and wired we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave

[Verse 2]
Hold ourselves together with our arms around the stereo for hours
While it sings to itself or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why

[Chorus]
Tired and wired we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
But I'll be with you behind the couch when they come
On a different day just like this one

[Bridge]
We'll stay inside til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
We'll stay inside til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume

Stay inside til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume on




Anything we should know about your change?
Was it nothing I said?
It's so attractive to be so silent
It keeps the mystery up
And it seems it keeps you hanging on me
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
It's one big question
I don't know why I must repeat it
Maybe I care a little
Perhaps I'm ashamed of the story I told
But she was so eager
Is it so bad for me to say what you wanted me to?
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
It's one big question
I don't know why I must repeat it
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
It's one big question
I don't know why I must repeat it
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
It's one big question
I don't know why I must repeat it
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
It's one big question
I don't know why I must repeat it




[Verse 1]
Did you clean yourself
For me last night?
Put the water out and donned a marigold
In your hair to bring me here
And tie one on you

[Verse 2]
Did you dress me down and liquor me up
To make me last for the minute
When the red comes over you?
Like it does when you're filled with love
Or whatever you call it

[Verse 3]
Do you feel alone when I'm in my head
While you wait for me
To take my breath?
Do you still feel clean
When the only dirt is the dirt I left?
How can you blame yourself
When I did everything I wanted to?

[Bridge]
You just made yourself available
You just made yourself available

[Outro]
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Dressed down and liquor me up?
And liquor me up?
And liquor me up?
And liquor me up?




[Verse 1]
All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
"Son, I've been hearing good things"

[Verse 2]
I wake up without warning
And go flying around the house
In my Sauvignon, fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror

[Chorus]
Say, "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind"

[Verse 3]
I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this

[Refrain]
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

[Verse 4]
Baby come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay

[Verse 5]
Just say something perfect
Something I can steal

[Chorus]
Say, "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind"

I pull off your jeans
And you spill Jack and Coke in my collar
I melt like a witch and scream

[Refrain]
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything




[Verse 1]
You're walking taller than you should
The air is thin around your beautiful head
You're saying things with your mouth to me
That I don't recognize
You're aware of yourself lately

[Verse 2]
Redefining yourself
Designing yourself
You haven't looked at me forever
Got a diagram of your associations
A strategy
You're weighing your options
What would you trade me for?
You're measuring me lately
And I can tell
And I can tell I'm losing weight
You're measuring me lately
You're dressing me

[Chorus]
Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same
I am the same

[Bridge]
Have you found him?
Have you told him everything?
Does he say he feels bad about all this?
You've shown tenderness for me
Tenderness for me
To him

[Chorus]
Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same
I am the same




Sweetie, you don't look so good
Your bottom lip is bleeding
I cut it on your collarbone
Go on, go back to sleep

Sugar, who were you thinking of?
You woke me with your breathing
Honey, how am I supposed to tell?

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

Thought I saw you on the stairs
Of this american century
I went up through all years
You were years ahead of me
Remember when you dipped your hand?
I never saw it coming
You took the wind out of me

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

I'd do better than you do
I'd do better than you ever will
When I am on bitters and absolut

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

I'd do better than you do
I'd do better than you ever will
When I am on bitters and absolut
When I am on bitters and absolut




[Verse 1]
I was home entertaining guests
When I fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out and they flew up their skirts
Cause they wanted to travel the world
I was home entertaining guests
When I fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out and they flew up their skirts
Cause they wanted to travel the world

[Chorus 1]
But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs
Gonna be a blank slate
Gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs
Gonna jump out of a cake
With my heart on a string
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs

[Verse 2]
I go out looking in parked cars
For somebody famous to kidnap and love
Beat off the army with a tennis racket
I go out looking in parked cars
For somebody famous to kidnap and love
Beat off the army with a tennis racket
That's my whole plan

[Chorus 2]
But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs
Gonna be a blank slate
Gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs
Gonna tackle young girls
Off their beautiful bikes
But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs

[Bridge]
Oh no, I thought I'd be by now
My head is a buzzing three-star hotel
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus 1]
But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs
Gonna be a blank slate
Gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs
Gonna jump out of a cake
With my heart on a string
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs

[Outro]
Oh no, I thought I'd be by now
My head is a buzzing three-star hotel
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No way that I thought I'd be by now
My head is a buzzing three-star hotel
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no




[Verse 1]
Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up

[Pre-Chorus]
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

[Verse 2]
Lay my head on the hood of your car
I take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car
I take it too far

[Chorus]
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are falling down from everybody I know

[Hook]
I'm on a blood buzz
Yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz
God I am
I'm on a blood buzz

[Pre-Chorus]
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

[Chorus]
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are falling down from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz
Yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz
God I am
I'm on a blood buzz




[Verse 1]
Crushed on the train
We'd stand by the window
Sweat through the hard parts of June
We hugged it out and ducked it on purpose
Nothing else I needed to do

[Chorus]
I was born, born to beg for you

[Verse 2]
Later that year in the back of the Warsaw
I thought you and I might be okay
Spinning and quiet
You leaned in against me
Said, "I'm gonna have it all some day."

[Chorus]
I was born to beg for you
I was born, born to beg for you

[Bridge]
I'd cry, crawl
I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl
I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything

[Break]
New York is older
And changing its skin again
It dies every ten years
And then it begins again
If your heart was in it
I'd stay a minute
I'm dying to be taken apart

[Chorus]
I was born to beg for you
I was born to beg for you

[Bridge]
I'd cry, crawl
I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl
I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything




I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks
Everywhere you go is swirling, everything you say has water under it
You know I keep your fingerprints in a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround, think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy

I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind every time I decide to let it go
I was up all night again, boning up and reading the American dictionary
You'll never believe me what I found, think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy




Never look her in the eyes
Never tell the truth
If she knows you're paper
You know she'll have to burn you

Never tell the one you want that you do
Save it for the deathbed
When you know you kept her wanting you

And do everything she'd never do

Fall asleep with stranger's wives
The wild wives of unknown men
Good for you, you've just become
Just another one of them

Never say you miss her
Never say a word

And do everything she'd never do
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes

Let her treat you like a criminal
So you can treat her like a priest
Girls forgive my human mind
Girls forgive me one more time

Never tell the one you love that you do
Save it for the deathbed

And do everything she'd never do
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes

Jesus Christ you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
Forgive me girls I am confused
Stiff and pissed and lost and loose

Jesus Christ you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
Forgive me girls I am confused
Stiff and pissed and lost and loose




[Verse 1]
I was a worm, I was a creature
I get on the ground the second I'd see you
You cannot command your love
I wasn't a catch, I wasn't a keeper
I was walking around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
Hand in glove

[Chorus]
So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion

[Verse 2]
I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store, I can't wait to see you
I'm walking around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
In the house of love

[Chorus]
So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
It wasn't so bad, I wasn't that sick
Got taken by love, I wasn't that quick
Foregone conclusion
It's gonna be different after tonight
You're gonna see me in a different light
It's a foregone conclusion

[Chorus]
So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
I'm already seeing stars in the air
It's a foregone conclusion




[Verse 1]
Take us down and all apart
Cherry tree
Lay us out on the table
You're sharp alright

[Chorus]
But no one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
No one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships

[Bridge]
Don't look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me; I'm indiscreet
Don't look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me; I'm indiscreet
You're sharp alright

[Chorus]
But no one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
No one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships

Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we?
Can we?

Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips

[Outro]
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we?
Can we?

Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships




Christmas magic
All the cold, hungry people
Christmas magic
Are dying in the streets
Christmas magic

But me and my family will be warm tonight
They'll be warm tonight
Warmer than those people




[Chorus]
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common

[Verse 1]
I got 500 in twenties, and I've got a ton of great ideas
I'm really worked up
I'm on a good mixture, I don't want to waste it
I'm on a good mixture, I do not want to waste it
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up

[Chorus]
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights

I have weird memories of you

[Bridge]
Parking your car, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were thinking out loud, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were parking your car, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were thinking out loud, you said "I'm overwhelmed"

You said "I think I'm like Tennessee Williams"
I wait for the click. I wait, but it doesn't kick in
I think I'm like Tennessee Williams
I wait for the click. I wait, but it doesn't kick in

[Refrain]
I have weird memories of you wearing long red socks and red shoes

[Verse 1]
Bottle eyes, glassy blue
I watch the rain come out of you
Sky is white with the flu
I'm terrified of losing you
If I go to the sea
I'll bring you down, down with me
If I go to the rain
You'll never see me again

[Chorus]
You've got cold girl fever
You've got cold girl fever

[Verse 2]
I promised to leave if you ever went cold
Then leave when I'm sleeping, you told me
Put your spine in your back and your arms in your coat
Don't hold on to me when there's nothing to hold

[Chorus]
You've got cold girl fever
You've got cold girl fever

[Bridge]
It's not what you said, but that's what you meant
I'm losing my baby on promises kept
What are you for? What are you for?
What are you for now that I have hardcore?
What are you for now that I have hardcore?

[Chorus]
You've got cold girl fever
You've got cold girl fever

[Outro]




[Verse 1]
I think the kids are in trouble
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Give them ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
And try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep

[Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
To all the silver girls
Everything means everything

[Verse 2]
It's a Hollywood summer
You'll never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together until our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone

[Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
To all the silver girls
Everything means everything

[Bridge]
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil

[Verse 3]
I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
If I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

[Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
To all the silver girls
Everything means everything

[Bridge]
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil




[Verse 1]
The first time I saw you, you were walking out
I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on something with your friends around
There was nothing I could say

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Verse 2]
The next time I saw you, you were breaking down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me, and I just turned around
There was still nothing I could say

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Bridge]
I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the trees
I have dreams of a first man and a first lady
Singing to us from the sea

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Bridge]
I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the trees
I have dreams of a first man and a first lady
Singing to us from the sea




I have your good clothes in the car
So cut your hair so no one knows
I have your dreams and your teethmarks
And all my fingernails are painted

I'm here to take you now

You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference
Everything I can remember
I remember wrong

How can anybody know
How they got to be this way?
You must have known
I'd do this someday

Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love

I don't have any questions
I don't think it's gonna rain
You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference

I'm here to take you now
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots
I'm here to take you now

How can anybody know
How they got to be this way?
You must have known
I'd do this someday

Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love

Break my arms around the one I love




[Verse 1]
I don't need you, I don't need you
Besides I barely ever see you anymore
And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there
Young mothers love me even ghosts of
Girlfriends call from Cleveland
They will meet me anytime and anywhere

[Chorus]
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

[Verse 2]
Don't do this, I don't do this to you
Don't expect me to enjoy it
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to turn the volume up inside my ears
For years I used to put my head inside the speakers
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever

[Chorus]
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

[Verse 3]
I get a little punchy with the vodka just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did
But he had to deal with those people like you who made no goddamn common sense
I’d rather walk all the way home right now than to spend one more second in this place
I’m exactly like you Valentine, just come outside and leave with me

[Bridge]
Let's just get high enough to see our problems
Let’s just get high enough to see our fathers’ houses

[Chorus]
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?




[Verse 1]
When I think of you in the city
The sight of you among the sites
I get this sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
Never kept me up before
Now I’ve been awake for days
I can’t fight it anymore
I’m going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
Do my crying underwater
I can’t get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It’s become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

[Chorus]
But I stay down
With my demons
But I stay down
With my demons

[Verse 2]
Buts and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don’t even wonder why
Hide among the younger viewers
Huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
Wish that I could rise above it

[Chorus]
But I stay down
With my demons
But I stay down
With my demons

[Verse 3]
Can I stay here? I can sleep, on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms, on the door
Do not think I’m going places anymore
Wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, everyday I start so great
Then the sunlight dims
The less I look
The more I see the pythons in the limbs
Do not know what’s wrong with me
The sour is in the cut
When I walk into a room
I do not light it up
Fuck

[Chorus]
But I stay down
With my demons
But I stay down
With my demons




[Verse 1]
Gold light breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand upright
Hit my head up on the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

[Verse 2]
I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I wept for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
Cause I was not supposed to be here

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen

[Verse 3]
I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
Don't think anybody I know is awake
Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say "a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me"

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind" (dead seriously)

[Verse 4]
Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about…
What I wanna say to the girls at the door
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me
Calm down, it's alright
Lead my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say "a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me"

[Chorus]
I'm not alone (dead seriously)
I'll never be (don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (dead seriously)
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind" (dead seriously)




[Verse 1]
Put the pervert in a suit
Take him out and light him up
Get him out of your system and warm
Your brand new bones

[Verse 2]
Sweep him in a shopping bag
Call a car and take him slow through NoLIta
Driver, surprise me

[Chorus]
Any rose red whore
With impeccable taste
We'll take the place over and let him go
Driver, surprise me

[Verse 2]
Whatever works for you
I'm brand new, reinvented
Without a scratch
Daisy-fresh and arrow-straight

[Verse 3]
That's a beautiful name
Can I take it?
Cause I don't remember anyone
And nothing reminds me

[Verse 4]
I'm a brand new house
The red girl swings somewhere else
Driver, surprise me

[Chorus]
Any rose red whore
With impeccable taste
We'll take the place over, let him go
We'll let him blow in the eyes
We'll let him float in the drinks
Of the beautiful boys and the beautiful girls

[Bridge]
I'll find her jewelry in my room
I'll find her voice in my mouth
I'll wear her clothes until she comes home
I'll find her number in my phone

[Refrain]
Driver, darling, driver
Driver, darling, driver
Driver, darling, driver
Never take me home

[Coda]
I'll find her jewelry in my room
I'll find her voice in my mouth
I'll wear her clothes until she comes home




[Verse 1]
You've been sleeping for miles
So what did you see?
Here the sky's been falling white flowers
And there's ice in all the trees
I've been tapping the table
I've been hoping to drink
There's a line that goes all the way from my childhood to you

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

[Verse 2]
I've been trying to see where you're going, but you're so hard to follow
And I don't think we're getting anywhere any time soon
We have so much to cover and I don't know what I'm expecting
You just keep saying so many things that I wish you won't

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

[Verse 3]
I've been talking about you to myself
Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything
I've been talking about you to myself
Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?




[Verse 1]
Can someone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling I lost today?
Can someone send a runner
For the feeling that I lost today?

[Verse 2]
Can someone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling I lost today?
Can someone send a runner
For the feeling I lost today?

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

[Chorus]
Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me

[Verse 3]
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
Put an ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself and home

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

[Chorus]
Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me

[Outro]
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the high, 'cause they're desperate to entertain

Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire




We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire
We're half awake, in a fake empire




In a fashion coat I, I float down my city
Don't you think I look pretty anymore
I'll do everything to you, but I can hardly come
'Cause I'm so afraid of you, falling

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

I'm not stupid, I swear
I read the foreign news to understand my nation
You get two options in the You Estates
Black city bloodbath or white country rape

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

Everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Oh, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it




[Verse 1]
You've been sleeping for miles
So what did you see
Here the skies been falling white flowers
And there's ice in all the trees
I've been tapping the table
I've been hoping to drink
There's a line that goes all the way from my childhood to you

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

[Verse 2]
Have there been too many times you had to walk me through everything that's happened
And I still don't get it all the way through
I've got about a year's worth of sick and desperate questions
And they're all about you

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

[Verse 3]
I've been talking about you to myself
Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything
I've been talking about you to myself
Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything

[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?




[Verse 1]
You keep a lot of secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some

[Chorus]
You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You tell me you're waiting
To find someone
Who isn't so hopeless
There's no one

[Chorus]
You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
How'd you get so far

[Bridge]
You're a needle in the hay
You're the water at the door
You're a million miles away
Doesn't matter anymore

Jennifer you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer you are not the only one
To sit awake until the wild feelings leave you

[Chorus]
You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are
You're fireproof
It's what you always say
You're fireproof
I wish I was that way




On my feet I stand tonight
Stand and step up to the light
An extraordinary man
Unbroken in a breaking light

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
Hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

On my feet I stand tonight
Stand alone inside the air
An extraordinary man
Everything stops and holds me there

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made




On my feet I stand tonight
Stand and step up to the line
An extraordinary man
Unbroken in a breaking light

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
Hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

On my feet I stand tonight
Stand alone inside the air
An extraordinary man
Everything stops and holds me there

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made




Hey, where the hell are you
You don't call me back, John
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me

Hey, where the hell are you
You don't call me back, John
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me

Show up here loaded with bells on your toes
I don't care what you're into, I'll put
Velvet ropes around you, if that's what you need

Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
John, you gotta get out and get back to me

Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Take his limousine, you gotta get back to me

I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine

I was in a train under a river when I remembered what
What I wanted to tell you, man
What I wanted to tell you, man
I got two sets of headphones, I miss you like hell
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me

I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na

Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Fake a heart attack, you gotta get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me

I've got two armfuls of magazines for you
I'll bring them over
So hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

Stay near your, stay near your television, set it up outside
And hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me




[Verse 1]
Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless
I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying, but I'm gone and through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine, and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen

[Verse 2]
Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying, but I'm gone and through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine, and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen

[Chorus]
All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means
I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us

[Refrain]
Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

[Bridge]
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you

[Chorus]
All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means
I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us

[Refrain]
Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

[Refrain]
Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace




[Verse 1: A.v.e The Mafia]

Mothera fuck that shit if you not gonna say nothin)

Okay now Raw shit I do this

Bullshit can't do it
Persistent, influenced

Potential, presidential going hard or going ham (Ha)
To head off all my thoughts
And them dreams trying ta make it count
Break my goal, Jump shot
Now Wages, pays, cash or not

Visions, Purpose, Success
It's worth it
Sum it up one word it

[Verse 2: J3]
Okay
Greatness is when someone tell you
That you can't do it, but you turn around and do it
Now that nigga looking stupid
Greatness when you in the club, turning the fuck up
Popping bottles, and all the pretty bitches showing you love
Greatness is my team behind me, Know what I mean
My nigga the mafia always strap with the beam (Damn)
Fuck what people think, don't listen what they gotta say
Along as you know who you are that's greatness everyday. (Bow)

[Verse 3: National]
My swag she loves it, This nation I own it
Can't fuck with me I chased girls
Now I sit back and watch them line up
J3 pick out all the finest
I hit the back room to feel the tightest
Bitch I'm greatness, greatness I am
Gave her the dick and she said (Damn)
I fuck with Drama, no baby mommas
Black May Bach, no Cadillac's
Like Jay-Z I'm spending money from 03'
Listen to my words, Made my first check
Put it in the market, Check my account
My balance says greatness, and she said
(You made it)

[Hook]
(Greatness, Greatness, Greatness..)
Visions, Purpose, Success
It's worth it
Sum it up one word it
Sum it up one word it
(Greatness, Greatness, Greatness..)




Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe

Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Now I hardly know them
And I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves




They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
For having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
They're gonna send us to prison for jerks

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
In the corners of front yards, getting in and out of cars
We miss being deviants

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We can't stay here
We're starting to stay the same
We can't stay here
We can't stay this way

Just tie your woman to your wrist
Give her the room to tie the other

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my




[Verse 1]
You're sleeping night and day
How'd you do it
Me I am wide awake
Feeling defeated

[Chorus]
I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I know it's not working
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
We just got nothing
Nothing left to say

[Verse 2]
Another year gets away
Another summer of love
I don't know why I care
We miss it every summer

[Chorus]
I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doing this
There's no other way
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
I just got nothing
Nothing left to say

It all, all catches up to me
It all, all catches up to me
All the time

[Chorus]
I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I know it's not working
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
We just got nothing
Nothing left to say

I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doing this
There's no other way
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
I just got nothing
Nothing left to say

It all, all just catches up to me
It all, all catches up to me
All the time




I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day
I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You're beautiful and close and young
In those ways we were the same
There's a lot I've not forgotten
And I let go of other things
If I tried they'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air

I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
They're still waiting for the years
To cover what we can't erase
I'm not holding out for you
I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

You can all
Just kiss off into the air
You can all
Just kiss off into the air




I could walk out, but I won’t
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced
No one’s careful all the time
If you lose me, I’m gonna die

How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling, then you fall
Things are tougher than we are
I could walk out, but I won’t
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced

Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love

She’s a griever, my believer
It’s not a fever, it’s a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now
She’s a griever, my believer
It’s not a fever, it’s a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now

Because we’ll all arrive in heaven alive
We’ll all arrive
Because we’ll all arrive in heaven alive
We’ll all arrive




Take your time, use a year
That should cover what I owe you
And some things that you will never know
I wear your clothes til you come home
You'll know me by the way I'm dressed
And now they seem to fit me, better than my own

I give to you the safe side of the (cup?)
But I am tall as high beams, shine up my back
And I am straight as briars, come bending past

Just look for branches tied in bows, 'cause I love you to ribbons
And you can take them with you as you go
I took the hairpins from your head
And tried to ask them why they led you
To believe that you should live alone

I give to you the safe side of the cup
But I am as tall as high beams, shine up my back
And I am straight as briars, come bending past
Take my brother's pistol put it in your bag
Take my winter jacket and put it in your bag
Take my brother's pistol put it in your bag
Take my winter jacket and put in your bag
I give to you the safe side
I give to you the safe side
I give to you the safe side of the cup
But I am tall as high beams, shine up my back
And I am straight as briars, come bending past
You go shine it on these
You go shine it on these
You go shine it on these




[Verse 1]
I survived the dinner
And the air went thinner
I retired to the briars
By the pool it gets so loud

If I die this instant
Taken from the distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things round town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

[Verse 2]
All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimming
I got paid to fish them out
And then one day I lost the job

And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off"

I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

[Chorus]
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

[Bridge]
As a free fall advances
I'm the moron who dances
I was teething on roses
I was in guns and noses

Under the withering white skies of
Humiliation
Under the withering white skies of
Humiliation

[Chorus]
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

[Outro]
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it




[Verse 1]
It's so easy to set off
The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This one's like your sister's best friends in a bath calling you to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms when she was young and sunburned in the '80s
It lasts forever

[Verse 2]
The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendships
And bad taste in liquids

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This one's like the wilderness without the world
I'm gonna miss those long nights with the windows open
I keep re-reading the same lines always up at 5am every morning
Like a baby

[Chorus]
It's just the lights coming on
It's just the lights coming on

[Verse 3]
I have no positions
No point of view or vision
I'm just trying to stay in touch with anything I'm still in touch with

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The sky's getting white
I can't find a lighter anywhere I'm going crazy
But I'm not crazy
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you
I'll still destroy you

[Chorus]
It's just the lights coming on
It's just the lights coming on




I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can’t get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
You got out and said I’m sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I’m under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can’t get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

There’s some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It’s full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I’m under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can’t get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller




[Verse 1]
Don't make me read your mind, you should know me better than that
It takes me too much time, you should know me better than that
You're not that much like me, you should know me better than that
We have different enemies, but you should know me better than that

[Pre-Chorus]
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right

[Verse 2]
Can't you write it on the wall? You should know me better than that
There's no room to write it all, you should know me better than that
Can you turn the TV down? You should know me better than that
There's too much crying in the sound, I should know you better than that

[Pre-Chorus]
I should leave it alone, but you're not around
I should leave it alone, but you're not around

[Chorus]
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind

[Verse 3]
You think about something so much, you should know me better than that
Start this slide out of touch, you should know me better than that
Tell yourself it's only noise, you should know me better than that
Learn to appreciate the void, you should know me better than that

[Chorus]
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind




We look younger than we feel
And older than we are
Now nobody's funny
No god, they took our fashion week
That's a real bad thing
'Cause we have scars to cover

Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me

Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed

Nothing made a sound in Williamstown that night
And all the air was empty
Then what to my wondering eyes should appear
Nothing, 'cause nothing ever happens here

Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me

Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed

Nothing ever happened here
Nothing ever happened here
Bad things never happen to the beautiful
Nothing ever happened here




I wanted to show you John's star
And lay down with you in strawberry fields
You said you're gonna lay down here
You're gonna lay down alone
I thought I told you I was ruined by the stones

I don't ever want you to come home again
I don't wanna hear your call, your voice in my room
I am divine and my arms are stronger than rivers
And when you feel that way, you want to feel that way again
Forever

Once ruined, baby, you stay ruined
Yeah, once ruined, baby, you stay ruined

Anything is beautiful and I blame you
I woke up in your sheets of rain
And everything you touch around here
You leave a stain

Once ruined, baby, you stay ruined
Yeah, once ruined, baby, you stay ruined




[Verse 1]
Karen, I'm not taking sides
I don't think I'll ever do that again
I'll end up winning and I won't know why
I'm really trying to shine here, I'm really trying
You're changing clothes and closing windows on me all the time

[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

[Verse 2]
Karen, we should call your father, maybe it's just a phase
He'll know the trick to get a wayward soul to change his ways
It's a common fetish, for a doting man, to ballerina on the coffee table cock in hand

[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

[Bridge]
Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title

[Verse 3]
Karen put me in a chair, fuck me and make me a drink
I lost direction and I'm past my peak
I'm telling you, this isn't me, no this isn't me
Karen believe me, you just haven't seen my good side yet

[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

[Bridge]
Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title

[Coda]
I must be me, I'm in my head
Black birds are circling my bed
I must be me, I must be me
Black feathers are falling on my feet
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title




[Verse 1]
I was home entertaining some guests when I
Fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out and they flew up their skirts and they
Cracked open the window and in came the
I was home entertaining some guests when I
Bees flew out and they flew up their skirts because they wanted
To travel the world

[Pre-Chorus]
These are the kinds of things we should worry about
These are the kinds of things we should worry about

[Chorus]
But I keep it upstairs
I keep it upstairs
I just keep it upstairs
I keep it upstairs

[Verse 2]
I was out looking in cars practicing smiles
For the grand finale
I got all day
In Cadillac city
I got all day
In Cadillac city
I was out walking, looking at posters
Someone famous to kidnap and love

[Chorus]
But I keep it upstairs
I keep it upstairs
I just keep it upstairs
I keep it upstairs

[Outro]
My head is a three-star hotel, oh no
I might be missing something
My head is a three-star hotel, oh no
Killers are calling on me
My head is a three-star hotel, oh no
Feathers are falling on my feet
My head is a three-star hotel, oh no
I might be missing something
My head is a three-star hotel, oh no
Feathers are falling on my feet
My head is a three-star hotel




Everybody needs a prayer and needs a friend
Everybody knows the worlds about to end
Everybody wants to know what the end will be
Everybody wants to look before they leap
Everybody wants a sip of wine to drink
Everybody wants a little more time to think
Everybody needs a reason why they run
Everybody wants to know what they're running from

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leaks
Love will lead us all to smithereens

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

Said it was everything
Ahhhh

Everybody takes forever to fall asleep
Everybody's got a lie they don't want to keep
Everybody needs a prayer and needs a friend
Everybody knows the worlds about to end

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leaks
Love will lead us all to smithereens

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

You said it was everything
Ahhhh

And I'm going to let it in
Ahhhh

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leaks
Love will lead us all to smithereens

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

Dying is easy
I believe my love and my love relieves me

You said it was everything
Ahhhh

And I'm going to let it in
Ahhhh

Awesome eyes, I need
People all I lean
Awesome eyes, I need
People all I lean. (?)




No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

Your father before you
And your sister too
Your husband and blah blah blah blah
You




So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins and cousins somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Losin' my breath
Doo doo doo doo doo doo




Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the Vanity Fair

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins

Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your heart in history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Don't be bitter, Anna
I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes




[Verse 1]
My bodyguard shows her revolver to anyone who asks
And yeah, she comes to attention when you come up to me too fast
For a little while you'll be here, the only good part of me
For a little while you'll be here

[Chorus]
So lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie

[Verse 2]
You wear your skirt like a flag
And everything surrounds you, and it doesn't fade
Nothing like this sound I make
That only lasts the season
And only heard by bedroom kids who buy it for that reason
'Cause you're the low life of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody
I'm in control and I believe

So lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright

From your bad blood

We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
It's a little too late, too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this?
Little too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this?

You know you have a permanent piece
Of my medium-sized American heart

We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
Are we gone
Come on yeah, we know we're gone
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye, we know we're gone

Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt

Are we gone
Come on yeah, we know we're gone
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye we know we're gone
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
It's a little too late, too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this
Little too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this

You know you have a permanent piece
Of my medium-sized American heart
So don't wear the watch
When you're out with the cunts
You can break what you have, but the rest of it's mine

Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt




[Verse 1]
Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside your head?
Is that sunlight on your bed?

[Verse 2]
Every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me

[Chorus]
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me

[Verse 3]
You could've made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake

[Chorus]
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you
You own me
There's nothing you can do

[Bridge]
You clean yourself to meet
A man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
With letters in your coat
And no ones in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart

Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you




Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside your head
Is there sunlight on your bed
And every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me

You coulda made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you

You own me
There's nothing you can do

You clean yourself to meet
The man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
The letter's in your coat
But no one's in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart

Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you




There's a place out on the edge of town, sir
Rising above the fact'ries and the fields
Ever since I was a child, I can remember
The mansion on the hill

In the day, you can see the children playing
On the road that leads to the gates of hardened steel
Steel gates that completely surround
The mansion on the hill

At night, my daddy'd take me and we'd ride
Through the streets of a town so silent and still
Park on a back road along the highway side
Look up at the mansion on the hill

In the summer, all the lights would shine
There'd be music playing, people laughing all the time
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall corn fields
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

Tonight, down here in Linden town
I watch the cars rushing by, home from the mill
There's a beautiful full moon rising
Above the mansion on the hill




You're pink, you're young, you're middle-class
15 blue shirts and womanly hands
Ok, it doesn't matter
But you should have seen me shoot up the ladder
You're miles behind your sister, la di da
You're miles behind your sister
Minor star of Rome

Your mind is racing like a pro
Not like when you were a kid a million years ago
It's a pity, but it comes with the uniform
You were wrong, you just couldn't admit it
But you didn't know how to do it, and everybody knew it
So you kicked yourself into the street
You could have been the skinny boy in the back seat
You're miles behind your sister, la di da
You're miles behind your sister
Minor star of Rome

Now sometimes you get up, sometimes you bake a cake or something
Sometimes you go la da di da da da di da all day in bed
Sometimes your eyes roll back into your head
Now you're having other people's dreams
And they're really good
But you wake up just before they end
You never finish anything
You're miles behind your sister [x3]
You're miles behind your sister [x3]




[Verse]
You have to do it running
But you do everything that they ask you to
Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look far away
As long as you look removed

[Bridge]
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

[Chorus]
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under

Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults

[Verse]
Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees

[Bridge]
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

[Chorus]
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under




Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worried about all those people
You don't never see those people anyway

I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway




[Verse 1]
This is nothing like it was in my room
In my best clothes
Trying to think of you
This is nothing like it was in my room
In my best clothes
The English are waiting
And I don't know what to do
In my best clothes
This is when I need you
The English are waiting
And I don't know what to do
In my best clothes

[Chorus]
I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that I believed in fate
I wish I didn't sleep so late
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders

[Chorus]
I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over
I won't fuck us over, I won't fuck us over
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that I believed in fate
I wish I didn't sleep so late
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders

[Chorus]
I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over




[Intro]
I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy

[Verse 1]
Murder me Rachael; I made a mistake
I loved her to ribbons
Loved her to ribbons
Murder me Rachael; I made a mistake
Murder me Rachael
Murder me Rachael

[Refrain]
I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy
So say goodbye to pretty boy
Just say goodbye to pretty boy

[Verse 2]
Her pretty little ribbons
Her pretty little name
Sew it in my skin
Never go away
Her pretty little ribbons
Her pretty little name
I sew it in my skin
She'll never go away

[Refrain]
I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy
So say goodbye to pretty boy
Just say goodbye to pretty boy
Tomorrow won't be pretty
Tomorrow won't be pretty

[Outro]
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her, love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons




[Verse 1]
You said we're not so tied together
What did you mean?
Meet me in the stairwell in a second
For a glass of gin

[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

[Verse 2]
Can you remind me the building you live in
I'm on my way
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous
It's a subway day

[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

[Verse 3]
Why are we still out here?
Holding our coats
We look like children
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?

[Verse 4]
Hey baby, where were you back there
When I needed your help?
I thought that if I stuck my neck out
I'd get you out of your shell
My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever
I need you alone
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?

[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there




My name, tonight
No, no professionals
No, no professionals
You can be smarter, yeah
There is no system
No Achilles heel to that system
Hey, professionals
You've been leaning on my dream
Been trying to find out what you can use on me
And you're leaning on my dream
Darling, can you tie my string?
My angel's face is falling
Killers are calling on me
Feathers are falling on my feet




Tonight there isn't any light under your door
I guess you must be somewhere breathing
Where skin and everything still know what they are for
And blood remembers where to go

I fell in love with you, no matter what you say
But you were right about the reasons
To turn a magdeline into the month of May
I shoulda known the magdeline was me

So I'm turning on the stereo
And I'm lining up the names
On the mixes I made before you
And I'm turning into fairytales
With glitter and some glue
Everything we ever planned
To ever do

Tonight there isn't any light under your door
I guess you must be somewhere breathing
In patterns unfamiliar to the one you're underneath
I pinned those patterns in my coat

So I'm turning on the stereo
And I'm turning into fairytales
Yes, I'm turning on the stereo
And I'm turning into you

I fell in love with you




I thought I'd come and see you
And your long and lazy scene

Given stage direction, finger on a magazine
I'll call you what I knew you
I can't get used to your new name

Send a body double over with your keys
She'll see you in an hour
Everybody quiet please
Essex House is down the road
The actors want to be alone

Your room is still and soft
As a jeweller's
Incidental music coming down the hall
Remember when I never had to wait for you at all
I wish my hands were yours
As I lay your keys on a magazine

Take me to LaGuardia
My baby's gonna pay for me

Bottle from the duty-free
I'll drink it all across the sea
Lay me down business class
Headphones and a sleeping mask

She's gonna pay for me
She's gonna pay for me

Brother, I wish you were home
Just tell me you're not alone
Call me back, I'm on a plane
I think I'm somewhere over Spain
I'm in the dark without the stars
I've never seen a black so dark
Thought I'd be above the rain
Somewhere on a higher plane

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My brother, I wish you were home

Baby, you're asleep by now
You never stayed awake for me
You never waited up for me
No, you never waited up for me
Now there is nothing I can do
I lost you but I beat the sound
Couldn't if I wanted to
The Concorde doesn't turn around

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My baby is in a room alone
My brother, I wish you were home




As we rode out to Fennario, as we rode on to Fennario
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O

Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O, will you marry me pretty Peggy-O

If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies in the area-O
I would marry you sweet William-O, I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few

And I fear my mama would be angry-O
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink

Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers
If ever I return pretty Peggy-O, if ever I return pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O

Come stepping down the stairs pretty Peggy-O
Come stepping down the stairs pretty Peggy-O
Come stepping down the stairs combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

As we rode out to Fennario, as we rode out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O




I couldn't find quiet I went out in the rain
I was just soaking my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street, cause you were tryin' not to crack up

It wasn't like a rain it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
And everybody was gone
I was standing in the street cause I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are

I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground

You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were standing in the street cause you were trying not to crack up
And Bona Drag is still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out

You said it will be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it will be painless
It wasn't that at all

You said it will be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it will be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sun kicks out)

You said it will be painless
A needle in a doll (when the sun kicks out)
You said it will be painless
It wasn't that at all




What would she do?
If she could kick time?
Would she go back?
Her arms were mine

Would you go back to four weeks ago?
And tell her everything
Whoever everything

How could she pick
And how could she say
She's already made too many mistakes
She's first at the walls, little baby ones

She tried to cage it if she weren't too smart for that
If she weren't too smart for that

She wants be happy forever
She just wants to be high
She wants to be pretty forever
She just wants to be tied

She be your mother if she had a choice
She'd make more money if she were a boy
We put her away, but she'd try it again
She'd try it again, and keep her mouth shut
Yeah, she'd keep her mouth shut

What would we do?
If it wouldn't matter
We'd still fall apart
One way or another
So would the city
And so would the east
And so on
And so on

She wants to be happy forever
She just wants to be high
She wants to be pretty forever
She just wants to be tied




Caroline laughs and
It's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place
In the side of our lives
Where nothing is
Ever put straight
She turns herself round
And she smiles and she says
'This is it'

'That's the end of the joke'
And loses herself
In her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk
Through in their coats

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?

All of her lovers
All talk of her notes
And the flowers
That they never sent
And wasn't she easy
And isn't she
Pretty in pink
The one who insists
He was first in the line
Is the last to
Remember her name
He's walking around
In this dress
That she wore
She is gone
But the joke's the same

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?

Caroline talks to you
Softly sometimes
She says
'I love you' and
'Too much'
She doesn't have anything
You want to steal
Well
Nothing you can touch
She waves
She buttons your shirt
The traffic
Is waiting outside
She hands you this coat
She gives you her clothes
These cars collide

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?




The first time I saw you, you were walking out
I wanted to ask you if you could stay
But you were on something, with your friends around
There was nothing I could say

I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me
I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me

The next time I saw you, you were breaking down
Other than that, you were a saint
You looked right at me, I just turn around
There was still nothing I could say back

I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me
I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me

I have dreams of ?
Singing to us from the sea
I have dreams of ?
Singing to us from the trees

So I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me
I’m gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I’m gonna keep you in love with me

I have dreams of ?
Singing to us from the sea
I have dreams of ?
Singing to us from the trees




[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
The first time I saw you, you were walking out
I wanted to ask you if you could stay
But you were on something with your friends around
There was nothing I could say

[Chorus: Matt Berninger + Annie Clark]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Verse 2: Annie Clark]
The first time I saw you, you were breaking down
You looked right at me, you were the same
Looked right at me, I just turned around
There was still nothing I could say

[Chorus: Matt Berninger + Annie Clark]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the sea
I have dreams of a first man and a first lady
Singing to us from the tree

[Chorus: Matt Berninger + Annie Clark]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the sea
I have dreams of a first man and a first lady
Singing to us from the tree




You're pink, you're young, you're middle class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go la di da di da di da da
Until your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck baby
You're dumbstruck baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck baby
You're dumbstruck baby, now you know

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck baby
You're dumbstruck baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck baby
You're dumbstruck baby, now you know

You're dumbstruck baby




I don't mind losing a girl to herself
A quiet love is better than none
And I don't mind losing a friend to a friend
If only to be a reasonable man

And I don't mind waiting if it's for the best
A careful heart is better than none
I don't mind painting my back with the past
Pictures in resolute pain
Smoothing the laugh o'er the lane

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door
If only to be a resolute man (Pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door
If only to be a resolute man (Pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man

If only to be a reasonable man
If only to be a reasonable man

I can turn everything around

All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me love




[Verse 1]
There's no saving anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the summer
There's no saving anything
How we swallow the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And its taking us over

[Chorus]
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And its taking us over

[Chorus]
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever

[Verse 2]
I'll go braving everything
With you swallowing the shine of the summer
I'll go braving everything
Through the shine of the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And its taking us over

[Chorus]
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
And it's taking forever




Rylan you should try to get some sun
You remind me of everyone
Rylan did you break your mother's heart
Every time you tried to play your part

Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Is it easy to seem so grand?
Wanna be alone in la-la land?

Rylan you could take the quick way out
You could turn blank-white in a blank-white house
Say that you're a pervert, you're a vulture
Don't you wanna be popular culture?

Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Is it easy to seem so grand?
Wanna be alone in la-la land?

Is it easy to live inside the room?
All the little kids are high and hazy
Everybody got nowhere to go
Everybody wants to be amazing

Rylan, California's rotten
Dress light-blue to be forgotten
Eat your pearls on Sunday morning
Keep the conversations boring

Stay with me among the strangers
Change your mind and nothing changes
Don't let's show any emotion
When you climb into the ocean

Rylan you should try to get some sun
There's a little bit of hell in everyone

Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Is it easy to seem so grand?
Wanna be alone in la-la land?

Is it easy to live inside the room?
All the little kids are high and hazy
Everybody got nowhere to go
Everybody wants to be amazing

Rylan you should try to get some sun
You remind me of everyone
Rylan you should try to get some sun
A little bit of hell in everyone

Rylan you should try to get some sun




What's that sound
It's a gravy boat comin' around
It's not a Navy boat, it's a gravy boat
Filled with bravery, savory sailor folk stuff
Sailors disembark
Fill our plates
Fill our hearts
Fill our hearts

Sailors in your mouth
What Thanksgiving's all about
Sailors in your mouth
What Thanksgiving's all about

What's that sound
It's the gravy boat comin' around
It's not a Navy boat, it's the gravy boat
Filled with bravery, savory sailor folk stuff
And sailors disembark
Fill our plates
Fill our hearts
Fill our hearts

Sailors in your mouth
What Thanksgiving's all about
Sailors in your mouth
What Thanksgiving's all about




I don't worry anymore
Nothing like I did before
I don't worry
I just watch them rolling back
I don't worry anymore
Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
And I wanna see 'em go
Cause it's all right, all right to see your ghost

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much

I will settle in and dream
Of a slow and funny scene
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
I will settle in and dream
Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna send 'em on their way
Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

Yeah, they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much




Oh you say you love me, Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

If I stay here trouble will find me
If I stay here I'll never leave
If I stay here trouble will find me
I believe

Joe, I'll always think of you
As the kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Oh Joe, you fell so fast

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don’t they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don’t they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don’t they?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing now
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down (don’t drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (don’t drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?
I see you rushing down (don’t drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (don’t drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?




[Verse 1]
I think this place is full of spies
I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room?

[Chorus]
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

[Verse 2]
I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you this river's full of lost sharks?

[Chorus]
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

(Don’t talk an ace and fold it)

[Outro]
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way




I think this place is full of spies
I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room

I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so and now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you this river's full of lost sharks

I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so and now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
And now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way




[Verse 1]
Wall Street jumps in the Hudson river
With gold in their bathing suits
Then we send in the miracle fairies
That's all we do

[Chorus]
Want to give a withering speech to the fucks
Want to give a withering speech to the fucks

[Verse 2]
We had beautiful views of the
Weather coming for us
We'll dive in with the sin eaters
While they suck it all up

[Chorus]
Want to give a withering speech to the fucks
Want to give a withering speech to the fucks

[Bridge]
Save my young white neck, it ain't my fault
Save my young white neck, it ain't my fault




[Verse 1]
We've been stuck out here in the hallway for way way too long
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss. I'm losing grip. The fabric's ripped
Go back to sleep, let me drive, let me think, let me figure it out
How to get us back to the place where we were when we first went out

[Chorus]
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

[Verse 2]
Losing parents, losing sense
I don't know what we should do
Became a father when I was still a son, she brings it out in you
See you at the end of the party with your wild white eyes
Filling up the teacup with gin in your secret postcard life

[Chorus]
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
We leave our saviors wrapped around the necks of new machines
Or at the ends of threads that hold their bodies to the ground
And then the men who look a little like they feel like me
Offered them some bottled water, then they cut them down
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different
Your voice was low, you blended in, I could barely hear you speak
You were always my last second bright spot in the distance
Thought that you were something good
That I would always keep

I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast. You as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast. You as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast. You as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast. You as well, beast

I'm in the city you hated
My eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead
My eyes are red

I'm in the crush and I hate it
My eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin
I tried to keep my skeletons in

Is it weird to be back in the south?
And can they even tell
That the city girl was ever there
Or anywhere

I'm having trouble inside my skin
I tried to keep my skeletons in
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up
And everything

But I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out

I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me

It'll be easy to cover
Gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before I realize

I don't want you to grieve
But I want you to sympathize (alright)
I can't blame you for losing
Your mind for a little while (so did I)
I don't want you to change
But I want you to recognize (that I)

It'll be easy to cover
Gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before you realize
That I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out




Sit down, dear, we gotta talk, you're acting like a kid
We don't wanna hear about the things you never did
You could have been a legend, but you became a father
That's what you are today, that's what you are today

Spending all your time, somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important life you could have lead
But your kisses aren't enough to keep your kids in line
So you better straighten out yourself and give your baby time
Cause if you don't give her what she needs
She'll get it where she can, cause she's lonely, man

Don't, don't leave yourself alone, for too many days
Cause sooner than you know you're gonna start, slipping

You'll end up talking to the ghost of your wife as if you knew her
Your eyes will put her everywhere
And spending all your time somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important life you could've lead
You'll fuck yourself to clear your head
You'll close your door and go to bed
You'll try to sleep without a dream
Cause that's where she finds you
Yeah that's where she finds you

Don't leave yourself alone, for too many days
Sooner than you know you're gonna start, slipping

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us

Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us

(Don't forget the alcohol, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby)




[Verse 1]
Standing at the punch table, swallowing punch
Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more stupid, a little more scared
Every minute, more unprepared

I made a mistake in my life today
Everything I love gets lost in the drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of sync from the beginning

[Hook]
I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightening
I'll overdo it

[Verse 2]
Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?

My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

[Hook]
I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightening
I'll overdo it

[Outro]
You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years

You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years




Standing at the punch table, swallowing punch
Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more scared, a little more stupid
Every minute, more unprepared

Made a mistake in my life today
Every day I love gets lost in drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of the sync from the beginning

It's easier than this, it's easier than this
Everything you say, there's water under it

Somebody bring me the head of a love song
Somebody bring me the head of a lie
Want to be a blank slate
Want to wear a white cape
Want to tackle young girls off their beatiful boyfriends

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick

My leg turns to sparkles, my leg turns to pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You can drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

So go now, don't make me cry
Everything you say, there's water under it
It's easier than this, it's easier than this
Everything you say, there's water under it

Gonna bring me the head of a love song
Gonna bring me the head of a love song
Gonna be a blank slate
Want to wear a white cape
Want to tackle young girls off their beautiful boyfriends

Gonna bring me the head of a love song
Gonna bring me the head of a love song
Gonna be a blank slate
Want to wear a white cape
Don't over do it, I'll turn round
Don't over do it, I'll turn round
Don't over do it, I'll turn round
Don't over do it, I'll go now
Don't over do it




[Verse 1]
I know you're a serious lady
Living off a teacup full of cherries
Nobody knows where you are living
Nobody knows where you are
Take a bath and get high through an apple
Wanted to cry but you can't when your laughing
Nobody knows where you are living
Nobody knows where you are

[Hook]
You're so far around the bend
You're so far around the bend

[Verse 2]
I'll run through a thousand parties
I'll run through a million bars
Nobody knows where you are living
Nobody knows where you are
You've been humming in a daze forever
Praying for pavement to get back together
Nobody knows where you are living
Nobody knows where you are

[Hook]
You're so far around the bend
You're so far around the bend

[Outro]
There is no leaving New York
There is no leaving New York
There is no leaving New York
There is no leaving New York
There is no leaving New York
There is no leaving New York




[Verse 1]
Doing [?] perimeter
A thousands of dollars a minute
Don't really know who my enemies are anymore
In the first place I really can't say what the matter is
That's what the matter is most of the time
What makes me think that they're any different from my friends?

[Chorus]
We are sinking fast
It's time to kill me
I'm leaking, they tell me
Never thought to think of them as just friends
Think it's time that I get back outside the windows of my neighbours
Am I ever gonna see you again?

[Verse 2]
For the end cut it sinks in the world
They could never pay for our lifestyles
At twenty everyone's becoming LA, LA doing meth
This is the space where The Doors cut their teeth
Well, I don't really care about that
This is the space where I don't really care about anything

[Chorus]
We are sinking fast
To kill me I'm leaking weights
Never thought to think of them as friends
I think it's time that I get back outside the windows of mine
Am I ever gonna see you again?

[Outro]
Sometimes I don't think I'm really around you half the time
Sometimes I don't think I'm really around at all
Sometimes I don't think I'm really around you half the time
Sometimes I don't think I'm really around you at all




And if you follow me, son
The wind'll wrap around you
Carry you from the ground
You will never be alone

Your weight will turn to sunlight
That's falling on a girl
You're still inside the world

She's reading books from empty women
They're giving beauty tips from empty hips

[chorus]
And how is the water of the rain
And how is the air of the wind
And how are the arms of your mother
She's holding you in

Watch them as they try to fly their kites inside their bedrooms
That were only built for drinking
Your thoughts, they never lasted long when you were under the sky
Above it you can hold a thought forever

[chorus] x2
She's holding you in
She's holding you in

Hey, hey, hey, hey...




[Verse 1]
Sorrow found me when I was young
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
Sorrow, they put me on the pill
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

[Chorus]
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

[Verse 2]
Sorrow's my body on the waves
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I live in a city sorrow built
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

[Chorus]
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you




Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt

I'm going down among the saints

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria!

Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria!

I'm going down among the saints

3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out

This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck-up




We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

You were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
We were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war




Sugar wife, sugar wife
Sugar wife, can you make me a man
Baby doll, can you make me a dad

I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly
I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly

If you tried to make a miracle
You never shoulda tried
If you tried to make a miracle

Sugar wife, baby doll

Can you make me a man
Can you make me a dad
Can you make me a man, can you make me a dad

Sugar wife




[Verse 1]
Tina lies on the ground
She lies there forever
She likes the sun
Tina knows the devil

[Verse 2]
Tina loves the violence
Of living in the country
She likes that it's
So far from me

[Verse 3: The National & Sharon Van Etten]
Tina has her story down
I really thought I knew it
And it changed around
When I was almost through it

[Refrain]
Sunshine on my back is the only kind I like
Sunshine in my brain is the lonely kind of pain
It's the sunshine of a lonely mind

[Bridge: The National & Sharon Van Etten]
She says "After today then there's nothing you owe me"
And I'm so glad that you came, I needed someone who loves me
But just don't try to talk yourself into this love
And sleep like a baby while I'm staying up
It's as much what you say, as it is what you don't
You can't try to stay you either will or you won't

[Refrain]
Sunshine on my back is the only kind I like
Sunshine in my brain is the lonely kind of pain
It's the sunshine of a lonely mind




We should get our signals strait
So you know when to come and save me
I’ve been looking for you all night
I throw a piece of cake at you
If you see me eating flowers

We’re in for it
But I won’t worry

Tall Saint, stay behind me
Everything’s fine
I believe in you now
I believe in you now
I believe in you now

I’m devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I’m in your house tonight
(mumbling)… takes us over

We’re in for it
But I won’t worry

[Chorus] x2
Tall Saint, stay behind me
Everything’s fine
I believe in you now
I believe in you now
I believe in you now

Hold out your hands to me
You’ve been eating flowers
I know what colors mean
I like the colors on the towers

Oh you (mumbling-oone) Tall Saint
Why didn’t I think of that
I’m in your hands tonight

Take me one time around the ballroom slowly
Then take me home

We’re in for it
But I won’t worry

[Chorus]
Tall Saint, stay behind me
Everything’s fine
I believe in you now
I believe in you now
I believe in you now

Tall Saint, stay behind me
Everything’s fine
I’m no good on my own
I’m no good on my own
I’m no good on my own




Keep your legs from shaking, fill your eyes with new tears
Don't ask questions, you don't know your name
Something for everyone, try to win prizes
Stay young and quiet

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint
Stay behind me

Don't tell everybody at the table about your dreams
They're too amazing, it'll melt their minds
Take 'em to Hollywood, cut out the good parts
Become millionaires

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I've been looking for you all night, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound
When I fell over and cracked my crown
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound
When I fell over and cracked my crown
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

But I got up, got in a car
Said "I don't think I'm gonna go very far"
Just take me one time around the ballroom slow
And take me home




Keep your legs from shaking, fill your eyes with new tears
Don't ask questions, you don't know your name
Something for everyone, try to win prizes
Stay young and quiet

[Chorus]
Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint
Stay behind me

Don't tell everybody at the table about your dreams
They're too amazing, it'll melt their minds
Take 'em to Hollywood, cut out the good parts
Become millionaires

[Chorus]
Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I've been looking for you all night, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound
When I fell over and cracked my crown
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

[Chorus]
Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you
Bubbles to the chandelier
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound
When I fell over and cracked my crown
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"
But I got up, got in a car
Said "I don't think I'm gonna go very far"
Just take me one time around the ballroom slow
And take me home




It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
This quiet company
This quiet company
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
This quiet company
This quiet company
This quiet company

And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes a while to settle down
My shivered bones
Until the panic's out

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
Company
This quiet company
This quiet company

But I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would but then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break




[Verse 1: Birdy]

[Chorus 1]
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

[Verse 1]

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge 1]
And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes awhile
To settle down
My shivered bones
Wait til the panics out

[Chorus 2]
It takes an ocean not to break [x4]
Company
It's quite a company
It's quiet company

[Bridge 2]
And I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would
But then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

[Verse 1]

[Outro]
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

[Verse 1]
We'll take ourselves out in the street
And wear the blood in our cheeks
Like red roses
We'll go from car to sleeping car
And whisper in their sleeping ears
We were here, we were here
We'll set off the geese of Beverly Road

[Chorus]
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome, totally genius
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome

[Verse 2]
We won't be disappointed
We'll fight like girls for our place at the table
Our room on the floor
We'll set off the geese of Beverly Road

[Chorus]
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome, totally genius
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome

[Bridge]
We're the heirs to the glimmering world
We're the heirs to the glimmering world

[Verse 3]
We're drunk and sparking, our legs are open
Our hands are covered in cake
But I swear we didn't have any
I swear we didn't have any

[Chorus]
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome, totally genius
Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome

[Bridge]
We're the heirs to the glimmering world
We're the heirs to the glimmering world

[Outro]
Oh, come, come be my waitress and serve me tonight
Serve me the sky tonight
Oh, come, come be my waitress and serve me tonight
Serve me the sky with a big slice of lemon

[Bridge]
We're the heirs to the glimmering world
We're the heirs to the glimmering world

[Outro]
Oh, come, come be my waitress and serve me tonight
Serve me the sky tonight
Oh, come, come be my waitress and serve me tonight
Serve me the sky with a big slice of lemon




[Verse 1]
It's so easy to set off
The molecules and caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes any difference

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This one's like my sister's best friends in her bed calling me to join them
Can't avoid it
This one's like my mother's arms when she was young and sunburnt in the '80s
Lasts forever

[Verse 2]
The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless ventures
And bad taste in memories

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I keep reading in the ceiling walls in the morning
Like a baby
Oh the sky's getting white
I can't find a liner anywhere I'm going crazy
I'm not crazy

[Chorus]
It's just the lights turning on
It's just the lights turning on
I'm all yours

[Verse 3]
I have no positions
No point of view or vision
I'm just trying to stay in touch with anything I'm still in touch with

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you, still distraught
This one's like the wilderness, without the world I'm gonna miss the real life, in my hide

[Chorus]
It's just the lights turning on
It's just the lights turning on
I'm all yours




Where crybabies cry in the United States
Bright white on both sides like a play
Nobody listens, nobody should
That'd be a waste of attention
Not enough money to buy a PC
So I'll come in this weekend, asleep on my feet
And if I forget you, I'll have nobody left to forget
I guess that's what assholes get

Traded my daylight
For a career

But I need you to disprove
My theory of the crows

Pouring my fingers across the keys
Will someone review my salary, please
I'm selling my time to the man who sells style
That time should be mine to waste on you
I'll suck off investors, I'll suck off VCs
I'm losing my posture from time on my knees
They treat me so well cause I'll do anything
It's in the nature of service

But I'll need you to disprove
My theory of the crows

Kids of the wealthy are raised by the poor
You send daughters to Los Angeles and New York
I need mine to see me when I wake up
I need mine to know that I'm what they come to
That I'm what they come to
That I'm what they come to
That I'm what they come to
When they come home




[Verse 1]
Nine years older than I was
When I brought you down to see
What I thought would make you fall in love
Where an old canal would dream
"Someday, man, I'm gonna be no different than the other rivers."
I tried to look at you but I couldn't break the ice
We stood out there for an hour and were freezing
You put your hand around my back
I guess you thought I needed that

[Chorus]
I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone

[Verse 2]
You wanted me to take you home
You said you'd rather be alone
I never thought of that
The car was warm and we had wine
But I couldn't find the perfect song
Now I own furniture, a 401, and crow's feet
And I can't even remember the car
Sometimes I can feel your weight when I close my eyes
Seven times I was under you

[Chorus]
I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone
And I don't wanna know what you're thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just drinking and drinking and drinking

[Bridge]
Shallow frame and shaky sticks but I know there's a river in me
Shallow-minded adult tricks but I know there's a river in me

[Chorus]
I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone
And I don't wanna know what you're thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just sitting there
Sitting down and fucking drinking




And who are you?
The proud lord said
That I must bow so low
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know

In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
And mine are long and sharp, my lord
As long and sharp as yours

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear




[Verse 1]
Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we’d never let anyone in
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets

[Pre-Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

[Verse 2]
I thought that this would all work out after a while
Now you’re saying that I’m asking for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets

[Pre-Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

[Chorus]
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way

[Pre-Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

[Chorus]
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way

Everyone's thankin'

[Verse 1]
Clearly you're wondering, glowing so hot from him - pink-like shivers
Turn around, let me tie your string, stand still - this isn't easy
All these weights and wires must make a skinny girl tired
All these weights and wires must make a skinny girl tired

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the difference between what this is and what it was?
Well, you got your pretty white bird and
Well, you got your dove

[Verse 2]
If that's what gets you off, I can't compete with the thrilling of Claire
All the after effects of three girls on two girls, I'll just help you finish off

[Chorus]
We'll be their pet, we'll wear their collar
Into the flame and off to the movies
The thrilling of Claire for the thrilling of Claire
The thrilling of Claire for the thrilling of Claire

We'll be their pet, we'll wear their collar
Into the flame and off to the movies
The thrilling of Claire for the thrilling of Claire
Into the flame and off to the movies

[Verse 1]
Clearly you're wondering, glowing so hot from him - pink-like shivers
Turn around, let me tie your string, stand still - this isn't easy
All these weights and wires must make a skinny girl tired
All these weights and wires must make a skinny girl tired

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the difference between what this is and what it was?
Well, you got your pretty white bird and
Well, you got your dove

[Chorus]
We'll be their pet, we'll wear their collar

The thrilling of Claire for the thrilling of Claire
The thrilling of Claire for the thrilling of Claire

We'll be their pet, we'll wear their collar
Into the flame and off to the movies
The thrilling of Claire, for the thrilling of Claire
Into the flame and off to the movies

Into the flame and off to the movies




[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
I was driftin'
Cryin'
I was looking for an island
And I was slippin' under
I pull the devil down with me
One way or another

[Chorus: MB]
I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait?
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait?

[Pre-Chorus: MB]
We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

[Chorus: MB]
I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait?
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait... it out?

[Bridge: Matt Berninger & Sharon Van Etten]
(All I have is all)
Think you can wait ... it out?
(All I have is all)
Think you can wait?

[Verse 2: MB]
What I'm thinking is simple
I'll sell apples and ice water at the temple
And I won't make trouble
I'll pull the devil down with me one way or another

[Pre-Chorus: MB]
We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

[Outro: MB & SVE]
I'll try
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
(All I have is all)
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
(All I have is all)
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
(All I have is all)




I was driftin'
Cryin'
I was looking for another
And I was slippin' under
I pulled the devil down with me
One way or another

I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait

We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait..It out

All I have is loss
Think you can wait..It out
All I have is loss
Think you can wait

What I'm thinking is simple
I'll sell apples and ice water at the temple
And I won't make trouble
I'll pull the devil down with me one way or another

We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

I'll try
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss




[Verse 1]
As far as I can tell
I'm nothing like a princess
But today I find myself
Curling up behind the house

There's nothing in the air today
Now I know I'm not so important

[Bridge]
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me

[Chorus]
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No dumbass dove in my brain
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No dumbass dove in my dumbass brain

[Bridge]
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me

[Outro]
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No I don't have a hawk in my heart
No I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in my heart
No I don't have a hawk in my heart
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in my heart
I don't have a hawk in my heart
In my heart, In my heart (I don't have a hawk in my heart)
No I don't have a hawk in my heart




[Verse 1]
Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in I

This is the last time

[Verse 2]
Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I've got Tylenol and beer
I was thinking that you call
Somebody closer to you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it I

This is the last time
This is the last time

[Bridge]
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant

We were so under the brine
We were so out of our minds
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant

[Verse 3]
Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in I

I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore

[Outro]
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything

It takes a lot of pain to pick me up
It takes a lot of rain in the cup
It takes a lot of pain to pick me up
It takes a lot of rain in the cup

Baby you gave me pain and tears
Baby you left me sad and high




No, nobody wants to be
No, no one's lover
No matter what they say

Lovers know they are the ones
Who one day have to go

Trophy wives, I know they wander
And find a young, young man
Trophy wives, I know they wander

One time you were a good rabbit
To all the girls
And all their lovely mothers

You tried a piece of everything
Now nothing turns you on

Trophy wives, I know they wander
And find a young young man
Trophy wives, I know they wander

Run, run, baby, I don't feel alive
But I'm pretty and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be alright to drive
To New Jack City for a younger man
With a better brain

I, I fell in love with you
No matter what you say
But you were right about the reasons

I don't want to be
What I'm becoming

Your trophy wife, I know they wander
And find a young, young man
Your trophy wife
I know they wander
And find a young man

Your trophy wife
I know they wander




[Verse 1]
Oh my Mother, let your daughter dance with me
I'd like to spin her wild around the cottonwood tree
There's something about her eyes, I think her roots are rotten
This must be the reason she wears her hair up in knots, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
This is so embarrassing
Ah, we're pissing fits
Crying on our doorsteps in t-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them

[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed
Light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower
Hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head
You have to get this turtleneck

[Verse 2]
The poor, they leave their cellphones in the bathrooms of the rich
And when they try to turn them off everything they switch to
Is just another man, in shitty suits, everybody's cheering for
This must be the genius we've been waiting years for, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
This is so embarrassing
Ah, we're pissing fits
Crying on our doorsteps in t-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them

[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed
Light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower
Hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head
You have to get this turtleneck

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed
Light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower
Hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head
You have to get this turtleneck




My cats fight
And play all night
And drive me crazy
I wake up and
They just sleep all day
Time went by
The old ones died
So we got new ones
If they could talk
I wonder what they'd say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa




Build a fire for Val Jester
Build a room for your love
Take your time when you tell her
How she lives in your blood

You should have looked after her better
You should have looked after her more
You should have locked the door

Fill her coat with weapons
And help her get it on
Cause one day when she goes
She's gone

You should have held onto her better
You should have held onto her more
You should have locked the door

All the most important people in New York are nineteen
All the most important people in New York
All the most important people in New York are nineteen
All the most important people in New York




[Verse 1]
Leave your home
Change your name
Live alone
Eat your cake

[Chorus]
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
O, the water's a-rising
Still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven
Swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks

I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry, my wife would know how to fix it
Hole in the middle, I'm seeing less of you
Now I'm not going anywhere and I don't know what I'll do

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

I never tell my decisions to the ones I adore
I just show up like a bible breather outside the door
But when I look out the window I see Girls on TV
Living and dying in L.A. and it means nothing to me

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
So I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again

Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them
Today

I didn't have to explain to her that I wasn't deaf
She sat me down and lit some colored candles over my head
She said you're right, it's a living, but you're wrong for the life
You know you never should've listened to my father's advice

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
So I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again

Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them
Today

Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them
Today




[Verse 1]
I’m always thinking about useless things
I’m always checking out
I’m always mothering myself to bits
I’m always checking out

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget it, nothing I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

[Chorus]
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck up the place

I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back

[Verse 2]
I try to save it for a rainy day
It’s raining all the time
Until everything is less insane
I’m mixing weed with wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget it, nothing I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

[Chorus]
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck up the place

I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back

[Instrumental part]

[Sampled speech]
"People like you are still living in what we call the reality-based community.  You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.

Apparently that was written on a whiteboard with a red sharpie in the Roosevelt bedroom, sometime around Christmas 2007. Yeah, so I can't stay..."

[Outro]
I can't stay and I can't come back
I'll just keep awake
And I won't react
I'll walk through Lawrencetown
Along the tracks
My own body in my arms
But I won't collapse
So don't go dark on me
It's all alright
If I'm gonna get back to you, someday
I'll need you light




[Verse 1]
Every house on the street will get on their feet
Carry the sleepers out into the weather
From the violet cities
The violet cities

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll turn on their lights and open their eyes
Drop to their knees and they'll drink from the river
In the violet cities
The violet cities

[Chorus]
On and on, they'll lead us on and
On and on, they'll lead us on
We'll all get high and walk off
Into the country, ridiculous country
Where the blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me
The blue sky will smother us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll open their doors and they'll sing to the sun
We don't know anymore how to glitter, we come
From the violet cities
The violet cities

[Verse 2]
If we stand there and stare and everyone's calm
They may never find out that we came here at all
From the violet cities
The violet cities

[Chorus]
On and on, they'll lead us on and
On and on, they'll lead us on
We'll all get high and walk off
Into the country, ridiculous country
Where the blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me
The blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me




She puts holes through the drift
Through the drift
She paints ceilings on stars
My lover builds drills

She kisses my forehead
Then pays me to touch her
Then takes me to bed by the hand
Takes me to bed by the hand
My lover builds drills

Warm singing whores
For government
Warm singing whores
No no advice
No commentary thank you
No advice

We know these days should be better than these days
We know these days should be better than these days
We know these days

She kisses the cops on the lips
And she takes them to Paris
And tucks them in
She takes them by the hand
And tucks them in
She begs me to touch her
She begs me to touch her

She dresse in rainbows
And curls over to me
My lover refuses to let me believe
That men will be me
From revenge to revenge
To revenge to revenge

Warm singing whores
For government
Warm singing whores
No no advice
No commentary thank you
No advice

We know these days should be better than these days
We know these days should be better than these days
We know these days




You're cussing a storm in a cocktail dress
Your mother wore when she was young
Red sun saint around your neck
A wet martini in a paper cup
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest

Your eyes are broken bottles
And I'm afraid to ask
And all your wrath and cutting beauty
You're poison in the pretty glass
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest

You're all humming live wires
Under your killing clothes
Get over here I wanna
Kiss your skinny throat
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest




You stand now holdin' yourself
A little moon is coming in the room
You stand there still
Like you were in the arms of everyone you ever wanted

I was watching you well

I won't stop you, I won't speak
The water on your cheek is the only that's moving
I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
Standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

And I was watching you, watching you well

Why won't you leave me quicker?
Why won't you leave me?

I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
Standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

I won't stop you
And I won't speak

Why won't you leave me quicker?
Why won't you leave me?




Oh, well I just don't know
How you could go without permission
Cause where (well?) if you're not there
Well I just don't care for this omission

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day

So where did you go
And do you now know how to be happy
Cause here well it's pretty clear
When you're not near me I am unhappy

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for

Oh I've come to know
You had to go without permission
Cause it was how, how I wore you down
And how I dragged you round my sole ambition

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for, my dear




You had fun, but you couldn't get him out of the car
I guess mamma's boys only go so far
You went in and put a record on
To make it sound like someone was home
And thanked yourself for pouring yourself a drink

Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over

A cool, tall, drink of water
Is all you ever wanted to be
And if you had another wish to wish
You'd be fun and moving

But you can't talk to people, right?
You can't tell a story
You're tall, long legged
And your heart's full of liquor
And me and everybody are just ice in a glass

Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over




I was in a fog, I didn't notice everything
Was coming all apart inside of me
There wasn't anyway for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry

You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like me?

It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone


I'll do what I can to be a confident wreck
Can't feel this way forever, I mean
There wasn't any way for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
But I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry

You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like

It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you doesn't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you doesn't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
